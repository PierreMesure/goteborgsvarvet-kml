# Göteborgsvarvet as KML (and GeoJSON)

Due to the rising number of cases, Göteborgsvarvet and all its affiliated races [have been cancelled](https://www.goteborgsvarvet.se/goteborgsvarvet-och-hostveckan-2021-stalls-in) in 2021.

I was going to run the marathon with a friend and we decided to run it anyway. Since the path won't be marked, I decided to map it so I can use my phone and avoid getting lost in the heat of the run.

The end result is these two files:

* 1a varv: the first loop of the marathon
* 2a varv: the second loop of the marathon (and also Göteborgsvarvet)

I'm assuming we won't be the only ones to run it so I'm making the files available.

You can import them in a mapping app such as [Organic Maps](https://organicmaps.app) ([instructions](https://mapsme.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207895029-How-to-import-bookmarks-)) or Google Maps ([instructions](https://support.google.com/mymaps/answer/3024836))

The path was based on the map provided by the organisers on their website:

In some cases, I've adapted it slightly to account for the fact that we will have to run on the sidewalk and not on an open road.
